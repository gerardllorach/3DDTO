# 3D Digital Twin of the Ocean
Introducing the 3D Digital Twin of the Ocean, an endeavor dedicated to advancing and disseminating oceanographic research through innovative 3D visualizations.

## The problem
One of the significant challenges facing scientists is the collection of vast amounts of data from various research endeavors, particularly in fields like oceanography. Despite the meticulous effort put into gathering this data, there remains a significant gap in its visualization and utilization by civil society. The intricate nature of scientific data, often comprising complex datasets and specialized terminology, presents a barrier to its accessibility and comprehension by the general public. Without effective visualization and communication strategies, valuable insights derived from scientific research risk remaining confined within academic circles, failing to reach broader audiences who could benefit from the knowledge gained. As a result, there exists a pressing need for innovative approaches to bridge this gap, enabling scientists to translate their findings into formats that are easily understandable and actionable by civil society, fostering informed decision-making and promoting greater public engagement with scientific issues.

## The digital twin
A 3D digital twin is a virtual replica or representation of a physical object or system in three dimensions. It utilizes advanced modeling and simulation techniques to create a highly detailed and accurate digital counterpart of the real-world object or system. In the context of the ocean, a 3D digital twin would be a virtual simulation or representation of the ocean environment based on the data and knowledge collected by scientist and researchers. Civil society, together with scientists and researchers, can use a 3D digital twin of the ocean to understand, study and analyze various phenomena, simulate environmental changes, monitor marine life, and gain insights into oceanic dynamics.

## What is this project about?
The primary aim of this project is to utilize oceanographic data to develop immersive and accessible virtual environments of the ocean, with a strong emphasis on dissemination and engagement with civil society. Through the utilization of advanced 3D computer graphics techniques, our goal is to construct highly realistic digital twins.

## Current scope
### Realistic and real-time representation of the sea surface according to oceanographic variables
Being able to picture the sea state based on parameters like wave height, wave period, and wind speed is complex and typically requires expertise. While seasoned users may mentally conceptualize sea conditions with such data, it remains exceedingly difficult for non-experts to visualize. Conventional methods of visualizing oceanographic data, such as tables and 2D graphs like plots, bar diagrams, and latitude-longitude maps, often present raw data values, demanding further interpretation from users. This poses limitations in conveying the nuanced variability of oceanic phenomena, hindering broader comprehension and application of the information.

We are presently employing 3D computer graphics to replicate the sea state by integrating various oceanographic variables. Our strategy involves utilizing empirically derived wave spectral models and integrating data from real-time observations including buoys and ADCPs, to construct 3D virtual environments. Diverse computer graphics techniques will be explored to optimize our real-time simulations. The accuracy and fidelity of these simulations will undergo both qualitative and quantitative assessments to ensure their reseamblance to the real sea state.

### Digital Twins of observation platforms
Not only is the sea surface critical, but also the equipment and infrastructure used to measure oceanographic data play a pivotal role. Developing digital twins of these platforms can significantly enhance our understanding of their status and characteristics. Presently, our focus lies in crafting 3D digital twins of the environments where these observation infrastructures are deployed. Through this initiative, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into the conditions surrounding these vital instruments, facilitating improved monitoring and interpretation of oceanographic data.
